# Example Component: react-render-counter
> RenderCounter is a tool component can be used in dev environment. It can tell you how many times each part of your component has been rendered.  
> This is composed with a HOC and a pure component to count render times  
> HOC is also useful when you want to track render times for your component.

```js
import { withRenderCount } from 'react-render-counter';
